            <p>The Bagwell Center for Media and Art Gallery. Gallery hours are <strong>Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-9
                    p.m.</strong></p>
            <p>Pellissippi State’s Bagwell Center for Media and Art, one of the most modern academic facilities in the
                region, serves
                students who are studying art and media production. It is also a gathering place for community members,
                who can attend
                events ranging from art exhibits to children’s summer camps.</p>
            <p>Opened in September 2007, the Bagwell Center for Media and Art is named in honor of Ross Bagwell Sr., a
                pioneer in
                Knoxville’s cable television production industry, and his family. The 29,370-square-foot building,
                located on the Hardin
                Valley Campus, has hosted artists, photographers, graphic designers, filmmakers, and video production
                and visual arts
                leaders from around the world.</p>
            <p>More than simply a learning and teaching facility, the Bagwell Center is a place where students, faculty
                and staff, and
                community members can participate together in The Arts at Pellissippi State.</p>
